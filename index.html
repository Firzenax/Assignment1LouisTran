    <div style="height: 32px"></div>
    <p>
      Last year in my home school EFREI, we had a class called UX/UI design and
      it was something that really intrested me and that I wanted to learn more
      about. When I saw the description of this course I thougth it would be a
      good opportunity to deepen my knowledge about the world of design while
      reinforcing my skills in web development.
