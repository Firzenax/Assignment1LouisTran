    <p>
      I am an exchange student from France who is coming to JÃ¶nkoping university
      for my last year of master
    </p>

    <h2>Why did he take this class ?</h2>

    <p>
      Last year in my home school EFREI, we had a class called UX/UI design and
      it was something that really intrested me and that I wanted to learn more
      about. When I saw the description of this course I thougth it would be a
      good opportunity to deepen my knowledge about the world of design while
      reinforcing my skills in web development.
    </p>

    <h2>What other class did he take in JU ?</h2>
    <p>
      I took 3 class for this semester, the first one was swedish language and
      culture because I am a curious person who wants to learn as many language
      as possible during his lifetime and also I believe that its best to know
      about the culture of a country where you will live 4 months.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also took the class of Development for mobile, wearable and smart
      device. I love mobile development ever since I discovered Flutter and I
      wanted to know about other way to do mobile development.
